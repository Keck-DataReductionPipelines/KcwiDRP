0. QUICK START:

Follow these instructions and you'll be up and running quickly.  For details
see the full installation instructions below.

Substitute the real version number for <ver> and real paths for
'/Path/to/package' and '/Path/to/tarball'.  Trailing slashes are
significant in step e.  NOTE: It is very important to put the kderp
package path at the head of the list of paths in the IDL_PATH
environment variable.

a. mkdir /Path/to/package
b. cd /Path/to/package
c. tar -xvzf /Path/to/tarball/kderp-<ver>.tar.gz
d. setenv IDL_PATH "+/Path/to/package/kderp-<ver>:<IDL_DEFAULT>"
e. edit /Path/to/package/kderp-<ver>/startup.pro
	I. point !KCWI_DATA to /Path/to/package/kderp-<ver>/data/
	II. point !CWI_DATA to /Path/to/package/kderp-<ver>/cwi/
f. setenv IDL_STARTUP /Path/to/package/kderp-<ver>/startup.pro


1. INSTALLATION:

Installation requires four steps.  In all steps below replace the string
<ver> with the DRP version string, e.g., "0.1.2" (not including the
quotes).


A. Unpack the tarball:

All of the code is written in IDL.  As such, you can integrate the package
within a directory structure that is already in your IDL_PATH, or it can be
installed in a stand-alone mode.  Decide where you would like to put the
package, cd into that directory and issue this command:

> tar -xvzf /Path/to/tarball/kderp-<ver>.tar.gz

Specifying the real path, of course.  The tarball will extract into the
directory 'kderp-<ver>'.


B. Adjust IDL_PATH environment variable:

If you decide to make it stand-alone, then you must set your IDL_PATH
environment variable to point to the top-level directory, something like
this:

> setenv IDL_PATH "+/Path/to/package/kderp-<ver>:<IDL_DEFAULT>"

The "+" at the beginning ensures that IDL searches the entire directory
tree below the top level for all the code.

**** NOTE ****: It is very important that you put the kderp package
directory at the head of the list of paths in the IDL_PATH environment
variable.  IDL has a flat name-space and this avoids collisions with
routines with the same names in other packages.


C. Point !KCWI_DATA to correct directory:

The file 'startup.pro' at the top level of the package contains the
definition of an IDL system variable called !KCWI_DATA.  This must point to
the correct directory in order for the pipeline to function.  It should
point to the subdirectory 'data' within the package and should look like
this:

defsysv,'!KCWI_DATA','/Path/to/package/kderp-<ver>/data/'

Be sure to include the trailing '/'.  


Ca. Point !CWI_DATA to the correct directory:

If you are reducing Palomar CWI data, then you will also need this IDL
system variable to point at the correct directory.  This is used by
cwi_format_info.pro to add the general header keywords to CWI images.
It should point to the subdirectory 'cwi' within the package and should
look like this:

defsysv,'!CWI_DATA','/Path/to/package/kderp-<ver>/cwi/'

The other lines in the file should be left alone.


D. Adjust the IDL_STARTUP environment variable or file:

The file 'startup.pro' must be either pointed to by the environment
variable IDL_STARTUP, or it must be edited into your existing IDL startup
file.  If you are running the pipeline stand-alone then do this:

> setenv IDL_STARTUP /Path/to/package/kderp-<ver>/startup.pro

If you are integrating the pipeline with other IDL software, then you must
add the system variable definitions from 'startup.pro' into the file that
your current environment variable IDL_STARTUP points to.


Once you have verified that all the paths are correct, you may wish to add
the environment variable definitions for IDL_PATH and IDL_STARTUP to your
shell startup script so you don't have to enter them each time you run the
pipeline.


2. RUNNING THE PIPELINE:

All commands are issued at the IDL prompt.  It is probably simplest to cd
into the directory with the raw data.  No raw data files are overwritten.
Output files all have altered names to avoid clobbering raw data.

The pipeline has 7 stages:

Stage 1 takes raw images and performs a basic CCD reduction to produce bias
and overscan subtracted, gain-corrected, trimmed and cosmic ray removed
images.  For nod-and-shuffle observations, the sky will also be subtracted.
The major output is an 'intensity' image in units of electrons.  For object
images, a variance image and a mask image are also produced.

Stage 2 is an optional dark subtraction step.  If you are doing nod-and-
shuffle, this is not needed.  Check the file 'kcwi.link' in the output
directory for the list of what images will have the dark subtracted.

Stage 3 is an optional flat field correction step.  This will use the
continuum flat images to determine the pixel-to-pixel variation in the
ccd response and correct for it.

Stage 4 uses a corresponding 'cbars' and an 'arc' image to define the
geometric transformations required to generate a rectified object data
cube.  It applies this transformation to the object intensity, variance and
mask images output from stage 1.

Stage 5 uses sky images or the sky panels from the nod-and-shuffle observations
to calculate the slice profile response function and writes out a corresponding
'*_prof.fits' image.  This is then divided out of each slice to produce a
'*_icubep.fits', profile-corrected data cube.  The variance and mask cubes
'*_vcubep.fits' and '*_mcubep.fits' are written out as well.

Stage 6 uses dome flats to derive a slice-to-slice correction relative to
a reference slice (defaults to slice 11, or the twelfth slice from the left).
It writes out the relative response functions for each slice in a '*_rr.fits'
image.  This is then divided out of each spatial column of each slice to
produce a '*_icuber.fits', response-corrected data cube along with the
corresponding '*_vcuber.fits' and '*_mcuber.fits' variance and mask cubes.

Stage 7 uses a standard star observation to generate an inverse sensitivity
curve which is applied to the corresponding observations to flux calibrate
them.

Each step is controlled by the master 'link' file which defaults to
kcwi.link.  and a corresponding 'ppar' file which defaults to kcwi.ppar.
These are generated by running the KCWI_PREP program with the appropriate
options for your needs.  Run KCWI_PREP with the /help keyword set and it
will print all the available options for you.

The link file allows you to see the automatic associations that are made and 
to adjust which images are processed.  The ppar file allows you to adjust the
pipeline parameters for each stage.

Stage 0 - preparation:

Here you choose several options for processing.  To see the
parameters and keywords that are available, issue the command with the /help
keyword set:

IDL> kcwi_prep,/help

These are the parameters:

Indir		- Input directory, location of raw images, defaults to current.
Outdir		- Output directory, defaults to ./redux/
Datdir		- Data directory, defaults to IDL system variable !KCWI_DATA

These are the keywords:

/CWI		- skip initial bias image and apply CWI associations (for CWI)
/NOCRREJECT	- turn off CR rejection (good for quick look)
/NONASSUB	- turn off nod-and-shuffle subtraction (why?)
/SAVEINTIMS	- save intermediate images (takes a lot of disk space)
/INCLUDETEST	- includes images of type 'test' (focus images, etc.)
/DOMEPRIORITY	- set to give priority to dome flats over twilight flats
/CLOBBER	- set to overwrite output files (otherwise it won't)
/NOCLEANCOEFFS	- turn off cleaning the wavelength coefficients of errant bars
/HELP		- print the command usage info

VERBOSE		- verbosity level for extra diagnostic output (1 is recommended)
DISPLAY		- display level for extra diagnostic plots:
			0 - display no plots
			1 - display some plots, non-interactive
			2 - display more plots, interactive
			3 - display even more plots, interactive
		NOTE: These can be overridden for each stage on the IDL
		command line by using verbose and display keywords in the
		stage invocation (see below).

MINGROUPBIAS	- minimum required number of bias frames to combine
			this defaults to 5
MINGROUPDARK	- minimum required number of dark frames to combine
			this defaults to 3
MINOSCANPIX	- minimum number of overscan pixels in a given row
			this defaults to 70
FILESPEC	- string overriding default file spec ('image????.fit*')
FROOT		- string overriding default file root ('image')
FDIGITS		- integer overriding the default image number digits (4)

PKSIG		- significance of peaks found for wavelength soln. (1.5)
PKDEL		- arc line matching threshold in Ang (0.75)
PKISO		- atlas line isolation window in Ang (2.0)

Once you have decided on the options just execute it. For example:

IDL> kcwi_prep,/skip1bias,/verbose,display=2

This will run very quickly.  It will prompt you to create the output
directory if it doesn't exist.  Exit IDL and look in the output directory
(redux is the default):

> cd redux
> ls

You'll see all the files that specify Master calibration file generation
(specific ppar files), as well as a log file.  Look at the kcwi.link file.
This shows the automatically generated linking between the master
calibrations and the other images.  The first entry on each line is the
image number being operated on.  This is followed by the automatic
associations to master (combined) files or individual image numbers.  The
first is the master bias file number, followed by the master dark file
number, the master flat file number, the continuum bars image number, the
arc image number, the profile correction image number, the sky image
number, the relative response image number, and the standard star image
number.  After this is configuration information that allows you to assess
the correctness of the association.

This file is read in by all subsequent stages so you can control which
images are processed by commenting out any you don't want run through the
pipeline.  Do this by inserting the '#' character at the beginning of the
line.  This will ensure that the line gets skipped by all subsequent
processing.  NB: be careful of the flow-down effect of not processing any
of the calibration images like arcs that need to be processed for
subsequent calibration.  You can also change which master file or other
standard image number is applied to each object image by editing this file.
Do this with caution as incorrect associations can result in pipeline
failures or unpredictable results.

You can also edit the kcwi.ppar file and change some of the processing
options.  You can turn on or off verbose output for example.  The most
likely change you'll want to make is adjusting the DISPLAY parameter (see
the description above).  It's a good idea to run the pipeline first with
DISPLAY set to 2 or more so you can see the details of what is going on.
After that, if you have a lot of images to process, you'll want to make the
pipeline less interactive by setting DISPLAY to 1 or less.  If you set the
keywords properly on the command line, it is unlikely you will want to edit
this file.


Stage 1 - basic image reduction:

Once you are happy with the files, go back to the raw directory and start
IDL again:

> cd ..
> idl

Now you just run stage1:

IDL> kcwi_stage1

You can override the verbosity and display levels set in the kcwi.ppar file
(as set by running kcwi_prep.pro) for this (and any subsequent stage) on the
IDL command line with keywords, so you can also type:

IDL> kcwi_stage1,verbose=2,display=3

This will take longer to run, especially if you kept cosmic ray removal
'on'.  On a macbook pro with a 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 8 GB of
RAM, it takes roughly 30s just to do the cosmic ray removal on one image.
Typical total run times for a night's worth of images can vary from 10 to
30 minutes.

Exit IDL again and examine the log file in the output directory.

> more redux/kcwi_stage1.log

This keeps track of the parameters that were used to derive the intensity
images.  It logs the number of cosmic rays removed, for example.

The output images for this stage all have the same prefix as the input
raw image, but different suffixes that indicate what kind of image they
are: '_int.fits' for the intensity images, '_var.fits' for the variance
images, and '_msk.fits' for the mask images.  If you had nod-and-shuffle
observations, then there will also be '_obj.fits' and '_sky.fits' images
containing just the object window and just the sky window respectively of
the nod-and-shuffle segments.


Stage 2 - dark subtraction:

The input and output directories default to './redux'.  You can run the
command from the raw directory and it will find the files you already
processed in stage1.  You can control which master dark is used and which
observations are dark subtracted using the 'kcwi.link' file in the output
directory specified when you ran KCWI_PREP.

This step is run as follows:

IDL> kcwi_stage2dark

The log for this stage is in the output directory and is called
kcwi_stag2dark.log.  Here the outputs will be the same as for the
stage1 outputs, but will have a 'd' appended as such: '_intd.fits',
'_vard.fits', and '_mskd.fits'.

NB: this stage is optional and no harm will come from skipping it, if your
science does not require it.


Stage 3 - flat field correction:

You can control which master flat is used and which observations are flat
corrected using the 'kcwi.link' file in the output directory specified when 
you ran KCWI_PREP.

This step is run as follows:

IDL> kcwi_stage3flat

The log for this stage is in the output directory and is called
kcwi_stag3flat.log.  Here the outputs will be the same as for the
stage2 outputs, but will have an 'f' appended as such: '_intf.fits',
'_varf.fits', and '_mskf.fits'.


Stage 4 - geometric solution and data cube generation:

Once you are happy with the kcwi.link and kcwi.ppar files, just execute
stage4.  By default it looks for the kcwi.ppar file in './redux/', but you
can specify it on the command line.

IDL> kcwi_stage4geom,'./kcwi.ppar'

The first step will be to trace the bars in the 'cbars' image.  If you set
DISPLAY=2, you will see a plot for the middle row of each bar.  You can
enter 'q' at the prompt to turn off plotting (there are 120 bars).  The
program will then proceed without plotting until the next step.  You will
next be shown a plot of the control points for the entire image.  Just hit
return to proceed (assuming everything looks OK).

Next the DRP will extract the arc spectrum along each bar.  It will
cross-correlate each spectrum with the reference bar (defaults to center
bar of slice 11, bar 57) and display a plot (if DISPLAY=2, otherwise
nothing).  Here again, you can enter 'q' to skip the plots and proceed.

Each bar spectrum is then cross-correlated with a ThAr atlas spectrum using
a central window about equal to the nod-and-shuffle mask (central third).
This provides a preliminary wavelength solution that is accurate over the
central third of the wavelength range for each bar.  This is sufficient for
nod-and-shuffle observations.  For full-frame observations the window is
successively widened and individual lines are fit for revised wavelength
coefficients in each of 5 iterations.  If you kept the coefficient cleaning
'on' (CLEANCOEFFS=1), the DRP will print a list of coefficients that have
been fixed and, if you have DISPLAY set to 2 or more, a plot of each slice
showing the original and fixed coefficient.  Cleaning is done after the
initial solution is found and after each iteration for the full-frame
observations.

If you are reducing full-frame observations and you set DISPLAY=2, you will
next see a plot of the residuals between the arc bar spectrum and the ThAr
atlas.  Good fits will have residuals of smaller than 0.05 Angstroms, but
acceptable results can be obtained with even larger residuals.  In this
case, you will have to hit enter to display the next plot or enter 'q' to
skip the plotting of the remaining bars.

Once the wavelengths are solved, a diagnostic plot will be displayed (if
DISPLAY is >= 1) and the geometry values are calculated and applied to the
relevant images.

Regardless of if you are reducing nod-and-shuffle or full-frame
observations a diagnostic plot set is output in the redux directory that
will allow you to assess the quality of wavelength solution for each bar.
This file starts with 'wave_' and the remainder of the filename
incorporates the bar spectrum image number and the arc spectrum image
number, e.g.:  'wave_cb1234_arc1232.ps'.  This will contain plots of the
coefficients as a function of bar number and a set of plots of each bar
compared to the atlas spectrum.  Problems can be identified in the
coeficient versus bar plots and then verified by looking at the specific
bars.  The specific bar plots will show problems if there is an obvious
discrepancy between the atlas spectrum and the bar arc spectrum.

If you have trouble finding a good solution for a particular bar or set of
bars, you can tweak some of the wavelength solution parameters in the
kcwi.ppar file and re-run stage 4.  Currently the most productive tweaking
is of the PKISO parameter which currently defaults to 2.0.  Problems occur
sometimes with over-crowded regions of the atlas spectrum.  These can be
occasionally mitigated by expanding the PKISO from 2.0 to 2.5.  You must
delete the the old geometry files from stage 4 or they will just be
re-used.  You can delete the old data-cube files or just set the CLOBBER
parameter to 1 to allow new data-cubes to be generated.  You may want to
move or rename the diagnostic 'wave_*.ps' files to compare with the newest
run to see if your tweaking has improved things or not.  If they are not
moved or renamed, they will just be overwritten.

The outputs from stage4 are the wave plot files, geometry save files, the
data cubes and the kcwi_stage4geom.log file.  The geometry save files are
named after the 'cbars' image that was used to trace the bars and will end
in '_geom.save'.  If you re-run the stage4 pipeline without deleting these,
they are just re-used.  The data cubes are an intensity cube '_icube.fits',
a variance cube '_vcube.fits' and a mask cube '_mcube.fits'.  If you had
nod-and-shuffle observations, there will also be an object cube
'_ocube.fits' and a sky cube '_scube.fits'.  These are useful for
diagnostics.


Stage 5 - profile correction:

You can control which profile image is used and which observations are
profile corrected using the 'kcwi.link' file in the output directory
specified when you ran KCWI_PREP.

This step is run as follows:

IDL> kcwi_stage5prof

The log for this stage is in the output directory and is called
kcwi_stag5prof.log.  Here the outputs will be the profile images,
'_prof.fits', and the profile corrected data cubes, '_icubep.fits',
'_vcubep.fits', and '_mcubep.fits'.

As a diagnostic, you can display the profile images with ds9 to see if any
contaminating source was in the sky observation.  If you find some
contamination, you can edit the kcwi.link file and use a different profile
image number.  Just be careful because the flexure in CWI moves the profile
image around a bit.

NB: this stage is optional and no harm will come from skipping it, if your
science does not require it.


Stage 6 - slice to slice, or relative response correction:

You can control which relative response (dflat) image is used and which
observations are rr corrected using the 'kcwi.link' file in the output
directory specified when you ran KCWI_PREP.

This step is run as follows:

IDL> kcwi_stage6rr

The log for this stage is in the output directory and is called
kcwi_stag6rr.log.  Here the outputs will be the relative response images,
'_rr.fits', and the response corrected data cubes, '_icuber.fits',
'_vcuber.fits', and '_mcuber.fits'.

As a diagnostic, you can display the response images with ds9 to see if
any of the response fits have gone drastically wrong.  You can modify the
kcwi.link file, but be careful to account for the configuration and any
time-dependent flexure when re-assigning relative response images.


Stage 7 - standard star calibration:

The kcwi_prep.pro run will attempt to associate any standard observations
you have with the appropriate object observations by comparing the object
name with the list of standard star files in the directory pointed to by
!KCWI_DATA+'stds/'.  This comparision is case-insensitive.

You can control which standard star image numbers are used and which
observations are standard star corrected using the 'kcwi.link' file in the
output directory specified when you ran KCWI_PREP.  Currently the standard
star library is extremely limited.  Currently the airmass corrections are
applied, but are only relevant for Palomar Observatory.  These issues will
be alleviated in the future releases.  

This step is run as follows:

IDL> kcwi_stage7std

If you have the DISPLAY parameter in kcwi.ppar set to 2 or greater, you
will see plots of the sky spectra used to sky-subtract the standard star
observations, as well as a final inverse sensitivity curve.  This curve
will be applied to each observation you have associated the standard with.
The inverse sensitivity curve will be output using the same image number
as the standard star observation but with a '_std.fits' suffix.  The object
files that have had the inverse sensitivity applied will also be output
with the following suffixes: '_icubes.fits' for intensity, '_vcubes.fits'
for variance, and '_mcubes.fits' for the mask data cube.

As a diagnostic, you can look at the inverse sensitivity curve.


3. ANCILLARY UTILITIES:

There are two useful utilities that might be of use to observers:

KCWI_READ_CFGS, and KCWI_PRINT_CFGS:

KCWI_READ_CFGS is a function that returns the KCWI_CFG struct for each
image in a directory so you can examine the configurations of your images
with KCWI_PRINT_CFGS.  You can specify input file specs to limit your
search:

> cd 130405
> idl
IDL> kcfg = kcwi_read_cfgs('./',filespec='image504?.fit*')
IDL> kcwi_print_cfgs,kcfg,/header

This will print a list of settings for the set of images matching the file
spec 'image504?.fit*' (with a header to identify the columns).  If you've
done stage1 already you can get the results as follows:

> cd 130405/redux
> idl
IDL> kcfg = kcwi_read_cfgs(/stage1)
IDL> kcwi_print_cfgs,kcfg,/header

This will read the configurations of all the *_int.fits images and print
them out.  There is a similar keyword for stage2 output:

IDL> kcfg = kcwi_read_cfgs(/stage2)
IDL> kcwi_print_cfgs,kcfg,/header


4. NEW FEATURES:

Quick Look Pipeline

For at-telescope reductions there is a new routine: kcwi_quick.pro.  This
routine will process a single targeted image, or if no target is specified,
it will process the most recent image with imgtype of 'object'.  It has the
same parameters as kcwi_prep.pro (see above) with the addition of the
keyword IMGTARG which can be set to a target image number.

This routine will process the target image and the needed calibration images
as far forward as possible based on what calibrations are available.  For CWI
users, be sure to run the header fixing routines first (see CWI_README).

Standard Star Associations

The prep routine, kcwi_prep.pro now attempts an automatic association
between standard star image numbers and target image numbers.  This is done
in a very simple-minded fashion by comparing the object name with the list
of standard star calibration files in !KCWI_DATA+'stds/'.  The comparison
is case-insensitive and the list of standard is fairly small.  The airmass
correction is now included in the calibration using the Palomar Observatory
coefficients.

Profile Correction Optional

The profile correction stage (kcwi_stage5prof) is now optional in the
pipeline and can be skipped if you are concerned that this stage is adding
noise to your data cubes.  The relative response corrction (kcwi_stage6rr)
can now take a data cube or a profile corrected data cube as input.


5. TROUBLESHOOTING:

1. No mouse reaction during kcwi_stage4geom:
	If the mouse seems to not be read by the program, check the X windows
	configuration and either set 'Focus Follows Mouse' or 'Click-through
	Inactive Windows'.

2. Missing variable or routine:
	If the pipeline stops and complains about an unknown variable or a
	missing routine, please contact Don Neill: neill@srl.caltech.edu with
	the details of the error message.

3. Bad wavelength solution:
	As stated above, three parameters are available to tweak the
	wavelength solution: PKISO, PKDEL, and PKSIG.  The recommended
	first tweak is to expand PKISO from 2 to 2.5.  There may also be
	good results from tweaking the others, but we recommend very small
	adjustments.


6. TODO:

This is a beta release, so there is still much to do:

-. Implement saveplots option
-. Implement nod-and-shuffle scattered light fitting/removal
-. Combine a group of skys to improve profile s/n
-. Clean up data structures to remove extraneous or repeated items
-. Implement an iterative wavelength solution for each bar
-. Implement non-nod-and-shuffle sky subtraction
-. Implement all configuration modes of KCWI
-. Install a library of calibration images and geometry solutions
-. Install a library of reference spectra for wavelength solutions
-. Refine flat field fitting to better handle fringing in the red
-. Keep refining calibration file associations
